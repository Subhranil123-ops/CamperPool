## 📌 Problem Statement

- In many colleges, hostels are located far from the main academic buildings.
Students travel individually every day, which increases transportation cost and fuel usage.
There is no proper communication system for students to coordinate rides with each other.
As a result, money is wasted and opportunities to build community connections are lost.

- CamperPool solves this problem by providing a platform where students can communicate and coordinate rides when traveling between hostel and college.
Students can share rides, reduce travel costs, and save fuel.
At the same time, it helps build a stronger student community through shared travel experiences.

- **Controller/**  
  Contains the business logic for handling requests and responses.

- **views/**  
  Contains all EJS template files used to render pages.

Remember our CampusPool design philosophy.

Whenever a component is marked as a placeholder, DO NOT improve it incrementally.

Replace it completely with the final production version.

For CampusIllustration.jsx specifically:

- Do NOT use Lucide icons.
- Build a custom SVG/vector illustration in React.
- Create an original illustration matching CampusPool's branding.
- Use SVG paths, gradients, filters, masks and subtle animations instead of icon libraries.
- The illustration should depict a student ride-sharing journey (road, route, campus, vehicle) in a modern SaaS style similar in quality to Stripe, Linear or Vercel hero illustrations.
- It must be fully responsive, animated with Framer Motion where appropriate, and reusable.
- Treat the current Lucide version only as a temporary placeholder and replace it entirely.
